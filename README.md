A classic game of battleship played against a simple AI. The game is started by placing the users ships. Then the AI and the User trade shots on eachothters boards until someone's board has all their ships sunk.

This goal of this project is to get comfortable with TDD. The game will be created using testing rather than console logging and visualizing dom manipulations.
